# Spotify Clone

A web page that mimics the Spotify interface, developed as part of the Alura Front-end [Immersion program](https://imersao.dev/).
This project shows how to create a web app's layout and design with HTML and CSS, and how to use Javascript to access a fake api that works locally with a json file that has data about artists for the app's search function.
